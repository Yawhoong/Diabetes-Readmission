# Diabetes-Readmission

The topic of short-term readmission in public hospital has recently become more important due to the high cost involved and limited public healthcare resources.  Identification of inpatients with high risk of short-term readmission can effectively reduce such cost, and alternative medication can be provided in advance to reduce frequent readmission.  In our research, 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care data from 130 hospitals and 70,000 diabetic inpatients in the US was used for data mining and analytics for two objectives: (1) To predict diabetes patient readmission using machine learning classification methodologies such as logistics regression, support vector machine, XGBoost and neural network.  Our results showed that XGBoost achieved the best prediction with over 82% accuracy and 83% average F1 score. The performance of logistics regression and neural network also exceeded current developments. (2) To extract critical risk factors that correlates with readmission of diabetic patients.  Our results showed that number of inpatient and number of diagnoses are the two most critical factors in readmission prediction. These results provided valuable suggestions to inpatients monitoring policy that may reduce short-term readmission and public healthcare cost in the future.
